This repo personally helps me keeping track of books read and visited links.
Books labeled 'Artificial Intelligence' contains AI,ML and DL; books labeled 'Machine Learning' contains ML and DL chapters while books labeled 'Deep Learning' are focused on DL.

`This list of a topic-centric public data sources <https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets>`_
in high quality. They are collected and tidied from blogs, answers, and user responses.
Most of the data sets listed below are free, however, some are not.
Other amazingly awesome lists can be found in `sindresorhus's awesome <https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome>`_ list.
